# First steps with CV

At first, we can find basics of Computer Vision with CV2 and numpy in kernels and basics repository.
It contains examples and kernels code, associated with explanatory comments.
The second repository contains the lane detection project which is very useful for self driving cars.
It uses CV2, numpy, Canny Edge Detector and Hough Algorithm.
It is an interesting and funny project to start your journey in Computer Vision.

**Requirements**

pip install cv2

pip install numpy
