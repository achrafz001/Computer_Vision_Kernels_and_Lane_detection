# First steps with CV

* At first, we can find basics of Computer Vision with CV2 and numpy in kernels and basics repository.
It contains examples and kernels code, associated with explanatory comments.
* The Lane Detection repository contains an intresting very useful algorithme for self driving cars.
It uses CV2, numpy, Canny Edge Detector and Hough Algorithm.
It is an interesting and funny project to start your journey in Computer Vision.

**Requirements for Lane Detection**

pip install cv2

pip install numpy

**Ressources for Lane Detection**
* OpenCV
